# How to Use:

**To run** the Interactive Player, from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Eveep23/Interactive-Player/releases), you need to download the ".exe" file, clicking on the "Assets" from the latest version. 

**To play** an Interactive, all you need is the internal ".mkv" video (the .mkv include all the audio languages and subtitles). You can choose one of the download options [from here](https://archive.org/details/puss-in-book-trapped-in-an-epic-tale-interactive). Torrent is the fastest. 
Once you have the .mkv video file, run the Interactive Player, in the install menu (the + in the top left) find the interactive in your PC, and select that video file. Once is added to the catalogue list, you can click on it to reproduce it.

* You can switch the audio track in settings or when watching an interactive with the "L" key (first click on the console app, not on the video)

* You can switch the subtitle track in settings or when watching an interactive with the "S" key (first click on the console app, not on the video)

* You can pause the spacebar in the console!
